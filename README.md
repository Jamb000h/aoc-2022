# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for AoC 2022

Days done (hopefully) in both TypeScript and Rust.

## Inputs

Put inputs into `inputs` folder with a name `<day>.txt`.

## Rust

Solutions can be found in `rust` folder. Run with `cargo run`.

## TypeScript

Solutions can be found in `ts` folder.

### Installation

`npm i`

### Running

(omit npx if you have ts-node installed globally)

`npx ts-node index.ts <day>`

where day is the day you want to solve, e.g.

`npx ts-node index.ts 5`

### Featues

- TypeScript
- ES6 modules (import/export)
- Timing for solutions and parsing
- Simple CLI support
  - Creates directory, solution template and an empty input file if not found
  - Runs and times solutions for day
