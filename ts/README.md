# Advent of Code 2022 (TypeScript)

My solutions for AoC 2022 in TypeScript. See repository root README for instructions on how to supply inputs.

## Installation

`npm i`

## Running

(omit npx if you have ts-node installed globally)

`npx ts-node index.ts <day>`

where day is the day you want to solve, e.g.

`npx ts-node index.ts 5`

## Featues

- TypeScript
- ES6 modules (import/export)
- Timing for solutions and parsing
- Simple CLI support
  - Creates directory, solution template and an empty input file if not found
  - Runs and times solutions for day
